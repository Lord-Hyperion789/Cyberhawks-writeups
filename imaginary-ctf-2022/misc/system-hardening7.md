## By: Shuban Pal, Will Cheng, Srijan Atti

### The Challenge
   rooReaper wasn't lying when he said that he would be back. Seems that he's infiltrated the roos' new workstation! Can you investigate and secure the system?
   The challenge is best played using VMware workstation player. However, you may be able to get it to work with other software. You will receive the flag when you reach       100 points.
